"""Severity matrix — 72 cells mapping (rule, taint) to (severity, exceptionability).

The matrix encodes a single principle: **rules protect the integrity of
high-tier code paths, not the hygiene of low-tier code.**

Tier 4 (EXTERNAL_RAW) is the developer-freedom zone.  Python idioms like
``dict.get()``, ``getattr()``, ``hasattr()``, and ``key in dict`` are
expected and correct there.  The language permits these patterns for valid
reasons — the tier system carves out the code paths where they are not
permitted.

Severity scales with the *consequence* of the pattern at that tier:

- **T1 (INTEGRAL/INTEGRAL):** ERROR or UNCONDITIONAL — fabricated
  defaults or unchecked structure in authoritative code undermines the
  guarantees that tier exists to provide.
- **T2 (ASSURED/ASSURED):** ERROR/STANDARD — validated data should not
  need fallback defaults; if it does, that's suspicious but exceptionable.
- **T3 (GUARDED/GUARDED):** WARNING — partially validated data
  may legitimately use defensive access; flag for review, don't block.
- **T4 (EXTERNAL_RAW):** SUPPRESS or WARNING — this IS boundary code;
  the enforcement happens when data crosses upward, not at the access site.

A ``.get("timeout", 30)`` in CLI parsing is fine.  That same value reaching
a T1 decision path without passing through a validation boundary is the
violation — and the boundary transition rules (PY-WL-008, PY-WL-009) catch
that at the crossing point.

# Design intent — §7.5 calibration principle:
#
#   These boundaries exist because the language permits these patterns for
#   valid reasons.  The tier system carves out code paths where those patterns
#   are not permitted.
#
#   Rules protect the integrity of high-tier code paths, not the hygiene of
#   low-tier code.  T4 (EXTERNAL_RAW) is the developer-freedom zone — any
#   Python idiom is fine there.  Enforcement activates when data crosses a
#   boundary upward.  A .get("timeout", 30) in CLI parsing is fine; that
#   value reaching a T1 decision path without validation is the violation.
#
#   Severity scales with the CONSEQUENCE of the pattern at that tier, not
#   with the mere presence of the pattern.  SUPPRESS at T4 means "this
#   pattern is expected here"; ERROR at T1 means "this pattern undermines
#   the guarantees this tier exists to provide."
