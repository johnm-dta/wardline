"""Scan gate logic — three-tier signal model.

The severity matrix (§7.3) assigns each (rule, taint) pair a severity:

- **SUPPRESS** — pattern is expected at this taint state.  Excluded from
  the CI gate.  Tracked as a diagnostic counter.
- **WARNING** — pattern is suspicious but does not block.  Excluded from
  the CI gate.  Tracked as a separate counter.
- **ERROR** — pattern violates the tier's integrity contract.  Blocks
  the CI gate unless governed by an exception.

This creates an economic incentive: promoting data to a higher tier
(via validation boundaries) removes findings.  Leaving raw data in
hot code paths is expensive.
