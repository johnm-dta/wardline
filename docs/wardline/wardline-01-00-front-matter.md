### How to read this document

This document comprises two parts: Part I (the framework specification) and Part II (language binding references for Python and Java). Not all readers need all sections. The paths below route to the most relevant content for each audience.

**Tool implementers** (building a Wardline-Core scanner, linter plugin, or type checker plugin):
→ Part I: §1–3 (concepts), §4 (tier model), §5 (enforcement specification), §6–7 (annotations, pattern rules), §8 (enforcement layers), §14 (conformance) → Part II: A.3/B.3 (interface contract — read first), then A.4/B.4 (annotation vocabulary)

**Security assessors** (IRAP or equivalent, evaluating a wardline deployment):
→ Part I: §1–3 (scope), §4 (tier model), §10 (verification properties and golden corpus), §14 (conformance criteria and profiles)
→ Part II: A.3/B.3 (interface contract), A.6/B.6 (regime composition), A.7/B.7 (residual risks)

**Adopters** (deploying wardline on a project):
→ Part I: §1–4 (what it is, why, tier model), §9 (governance model) → Part II: A.9/B.9 (adoption strategy), A.4/B.4 (annotation vocabulary)

**Governance leads** (managing wardline policy and exceptions):
→ Part I: §9 (governance model), §13 (manifest and exception register), §14.1 (conformance model)
→ Part II: A.7/B.7 (residual risks), A.10/B.10 (error handling and control law)

**Citizen programmers** (reviewing or writing code in a wardline-annotated codebase, without developer tooling):
→ Wardline Lite practical guide (`wardline-lite.md`, separate companion document): five review questions, worked code examples, hot-path identification. This guide is not part of the formal specification — it translates the annotation vocabulary (§6) and pattern rules (§7) into questions a non-specialist can apply during code review.
