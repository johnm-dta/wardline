## Fail Requirements Blocking Conformance

| Requirement | Gap | Conformance Impact |
|---|---|---|
| MAN-014 | No YAML quoted-string enforcement | Norway problem possible; loader-level mitigation needed |
| ENF-009 | No incremental analysis | SHOULD-level; does not block conformance but limits CI scalability |
| ENF-010 | No pre-generation projection | Advisory; does not block conformance |
| GOV-015 | Audit retention not documented | Process gap; blocks assessor verification |
| CONF-005 | Supplementary enforcement scope undocumented | Assessor cannot evaluate regime coverage |

~~CORE-013, GOV-009, and SCAN-016 were the highest-impact gaps — all three are now fixed.~~ The remaining FAILs are: MAN-014 (YAML quoting — structural limitation), ENF-009/ENF-010 (SHOULD-level, non-blocking), GOV-015 (documentation gap), CONF-005 (documentation gap). None of the remaining FAILs block a Lite conformance claim.
