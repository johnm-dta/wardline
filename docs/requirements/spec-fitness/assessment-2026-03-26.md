# Spec Fitness Assessment — 2026-03-26

This is the first repo fitness assessment against the baseline in this folder.

## Rollup

- Pass: 17
- Partial: 10
- Fail: 8

Overall judgment: the project has a solid core implementation and test surface, but it is not yet fit to claim clean alignment with the current normative spec. The main issues are concentrated in three areas:

1. Binding-to-spec contract gaps: AST discovery and `schema_default()` handling are solid, but the normative restoration-composition contract and required run-level SARIF properties are not yet met.
2. Manifest and governance drift: `validation_scope` remains incomplete, the self-hosting manifest lacks ratification metadata, and Lite-governance controls are only partially evidenced.
3. Conformance evidence gaps: the scanner is strong on rule logic and two-hop taint behavior, but per-cell metrics, full SARIF property bags, corpus breadth, and substantive self-hosting still lag the spec.

## Verification Run

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit/core/test_taints.py \

Presence-check enforcement is also absent. |
| `WL-FIT-MAN-005` | partial | `src/wardline/manifest/models.py`, `src/wardline/manifest/loader.py`, `src/wardline/manifest/resolve.py` | Contract bindings are separate and name-based, but contract declarations remain raw dicts and cross-validation is weak. |

| `WL-FIT-MAN-007` | partial | `src/wardline/manifest/models.py`, `src/wardline/manifest/regime.py`, `tests/unit/manifest/test_regime.py`, `wardline.yaml` | Ratification age is computed by the tooling, but the self-hosting root manifest lacks ratification metadata, so the control cannot currently pass on the repo’s own manifest. |

| `WL-FIT-MAN-009` | partial | `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `wardline.yaml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Path protection exists for the root manifest, overlays, and corpus, but exception-register and fingerprint-governance paths are not comprehensively covered. |

| `WL-FIT-MAN-011` | fail | `wardline.yaml`, `docs/audits/2026-03-25-rule-conformance/phase-2/f3/compliance-surface.md` | No temporal-separation posture or Lite-profile alternative is declared in the self-hosting manifest, so this governance requirement is not assessable. |

| `WL-FIT-SCAN-004` | fail | `src/wardline/scanner/sarif.py`, `tests/unit/scanner/test_sarif.py`, `src/wardline/cli/scan.py` | The scanner emits several required properties, but the full required Part I and A.3 property bag is incomplete, especially at run level (`inputHash`, `inputFiles`, `overlayHashes`, `coverageRatio`, and related fields). |
| `WL-FIT-SCAN-005` | partial | `src/wardline/cli/corpus_cmds.py`, `tests/unit/scanner/test_corpus_runner.py`, `tests/integration/test_corpus_verify.py` | Corpus verification computes and prints metrics, but current reporting is per rule with sample thresholds, not the spec’s required per-cell measured-and-published surface. |
| `WL-FIT-SCAN-006` | partial | `corpus/specimens`, `tests/unit/corpus/test_corpus_skeleton.py`, `tests/unit/scanner/test_corpus_runner.py` | Corpus machinery exists and is runnable, but specimen breadth is still narrower than the full claimed rule surface and adversarial floor. |
| `WL-FIT-SCAN-007` | partial | `tests/integration/test_self_hosting.py`, `tests/integration/test_self_hosting_scan.py`, `docs/audits/2026-03-25-rule-conformance/phase-2/f3/compliance-surface.md` | Self-hosting is exercised, but the current gate is closer to stability checking than a strict “passes its own rules” conformance claim. |
| `WL-FIT-SCAN-008` | partial | `src/wardline/scanner/sarif.py`, `docs/audits/2026-03-25-rule-conformance/phase-2/f3/compliance-surface.md` | The scanner documents and emits implemented rules, but the machine-readable conformance surface still reports no conformance gaps despite tracked gaps. |
| `WL-FIT-PY-001` | pass | `src/wardline/scanner/discovery.py`, `tests/unit/test_wp04_hardening.py` | Decorator discovery is AST-based and explicitly designed around parsed source rather than runtime reflection. |

| `WL-FIT-PY-003` | pass | `src/wardline/scanner/sarif.py`, `tests/unit/scanner/test_sarif.py` | The Python interface contract’s mandatory result-level SARIF fields are emitted. |
| `WL-FIT-PY-004` | fail | `src/wardline/decorators/__init__.py`, `src/wardline/core/registry.py`, `docs/audits/2026-03-25-rule-conformance/phase-2/f1/evidence-restoration.md` | The normative `@int_data` + `@restoration_boundary` composition contract is not satisfied because `@restoration_boundary(...)` is still missing. |
| `WL-FIT-PY-005` | pass | `tests/unit/scanner/test_delegated_rejection.py`, `tests/unit/scanner/test_rejection_path_convergence.py` | Conservative fallback behavior for unresolved delegation is covered by dedicated rejection-path tests. |
| `WL-FIT-PY-006` | partial | `src/wardline/scanner/rules/__init__.py`, `src/wardline/cli/corpus_cmds.py`, `corpus/specimens` | Rule declaration is explicit, but corpus maintenance breadth still lags the claimed conformance surface. |
| `WL-FIT-PY-007` | pass | `src/wardline/cli/scan.py`, `tests/integration/test_determinism.py` | `--verification-mode` exists and deterministic output is tested. |
| `WL-FIT-PY-008` | fail | `src/wardline/scanner/sarif.py`, `src/wardline/cli/scan.py`, `tests/unit/scanner/test_sarif.py` | The Python interface contract’s required run-level properties are incomplete; notably `wardline.inputHash` and `wardline.inputFiles` are absent. |
| `WL-FIT-PY-009` | pass | `src/wardline/cli/scan.py`, `src/wardline/manifest/loader.py`, `tests/integration/test_scan_cmd.py` | The scanner loads and validates the manifest against JSON Schema before producing findings. |

## Highest-Value Gaps

1. Finish the restoration contract.
   Add `@restoration_boundary(...)`, register it, and wire scanner behavior so the normative `@int_data` composition rule from A.3 becomes true.

2. Reconcile manifest terminology and validation behavior.
   Replace `bounded_context` with `validation_scope`, add presence checks for Tier 2 semantics, and reject skip-promotions to Tier 1.

3. Complete the required SARIF run-level property bag.
   Add at least `wardline.inputHash`, `wardline.inputFiles`, `wardline.overlayHashes`, `wardline.coverageRatio`, and other missing required run properties.

4. Raise conformance evidence from “tooling exists” to “spec requirement satisfied”.
   This mainly means per-cell corpus metrics, adversarial corpus breadth, and a stricter self-hosting gate.

5. Make Lite governance assessable on the self-hosting repo.
   Add manifest ratification metadata, declare the temporal-separation posture or allowed Lite alternative, and tighten CODEOWNERS coverage for governance artefacts.

## Suggested Next Moves

1. Fix the hard normative blockers first: `WL-FIT-PY-004`, `WL-FIT-CORE-006`, `WL-FIT-MAN-004`, `WL-FIT-SCAN-004`, `WL-FIT-PY-008`.
2. Make the self-hosting governance posture assessable: `WL-FIT-MAN-007`, `WL-FIT-MAN-009`, `WL-FIT-MAN-011`.
3. Then close the evidence-quality gaps: `WL-FIT-SCAN-005`, `WL-FIT-SCAN-006`, `WL-FIT-SCAN-007`, `WL-FIT-SCAN-008`, `WL-FIT-PY-006`.
