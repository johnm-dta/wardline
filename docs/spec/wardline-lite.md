# Reviewing AI-Generated Code: A Practical Guide for Government Staff

**What you need to know when you are the only reviewer — and there is no CI pipeline to catch what you miss.**

---

## 1. You Are Not Doing Anything Wrong

You are not doing anything wrong. You are using AI to write code — to automate reports, process data, connect systems, do useful work. That is productive, increasingly normal, and supported by government policy. This guide is not here to tell you to stop.

It is here to help you spot the one thing AI consistently gets wrong: **code that looks right but makes the wrong decision about data that matters.**

Here is a concrete example. An AI writes a script to process incoming records. One line reads:

```python
classification = record.get("security_classification", "OFFICIAL")
```

This says: if the security classification field is missing, use OFFICIAL as the default. In a weather app, that kind of defensive coding is fine. In a government system, a missing classification might mean the upstream system failed. That one line silently downgrades an unknown document to OFFICIAL — and nobody is told. No error, no alert, no log entry.

AI produces this pattern routinely. It looks like good practice because it *is* good practice — in most software. In systems where data integrity, auditability, or classification accuracy matter, the same pattern is quietly dangerous.

This guide teaches you to see those invisible mistakes, even without specialised tools. It gives you five questions to ask about any AI-generated code that touches data you care about. The code examples use Python and SQL — the most common languages for government data processing scripts — but the same patterns exist in every language. The five questions work regardless of which language your code is in. These are interim — automated semantic enforcement tooling will eventually complement them. A companion specification — the Wardline Framework Specification (`docs/wardline/wardline-01-00-front-matter.md` through `wardline-01-15-document-scope.md`, with language bindings in `wardline-02-A-python-binding.md` and `wardline-02-B-java-binding.md`) — illustrates what that tooling could look like; the approach is buildable with standard language tooling, and several implementation paths are possible. Until that tooling arrives, these five questions are your enforcement layer.

> **Why This Matters for Government:** A script that silently defaults a security classification to OFFICIAL when the field is missing does not crash. It does not throw an error. It processes PROTECTED documents at the wrong level, and nobody finds out until an audit — or an incident. AI produces this pattern routinely.


## 2. Three Patterns That Will Fool You

These are the core ways AI-generated code goes invisibly wrong. Each follows the same structure: what the AI wrote, why it looks right, what is actually wrong, what you should write instead, and what it means if this goes wrong in a government system.

### 2.1 The Friendly Default

The AI writes `.get(field, "OFFICIAL")` — if the security classification field is missing, use OFFICIAL as the default. This is standard defensive programming. Every tutorial teaches it.

In a government system, a missing classification field might mean the upstream system failed. The correct response is to *stop and investigate*, not to silently invent an answer. The AI just downgraded an unknown document to OFFICIAL and nobody was told.

```python
# WRONG — silently invents a classification
classification = record.get("security_classification", "OFFICIAL")

# CORRECT — missing classification is an error, not a default
classification = record["security_classification"]
# If the key is missing, this crashes — and crashing is safer
# than silently processing PROTECTED documents as OFFICIAL.
# (The full discussion paper §2.3 shows an even better version
# that crashes with a diagnostic error message — but crashing
# at all is the important part.)
```

**Q1 to ask:** "If this value is missing, is that *normal* or is that *evidence something is broken*?"

In the discussion paper's taxonomy, this pattern is called *Competence Spoofing* — rated *High*. The AI presents a confident result based on fabricated input. The code does not know the classification — it invents one and carries on as if it always knew.

> **Why This Matters:** This is how PROTECTED documents get processed at the wrong level. No error, no alert, no log entry. The system runs with a confident wrong answer.

### 2.2 The Helpful Error Handler

The AI wraps an audit-critical operation in `try/except` — if it fails, log the error and continue. This looks like robust error handling. Every coding tutorial teaches it.

In a system with audit obligations, a swallowed exception means an auditable operation happened with no record. If someone asks "did this transaction complete?", the answer is "we don't know — the error was logged somewhere but the audit trail says nothing happened."

```python
# WRONG — swallows the audit trail
try:
    write_audit_record(transaction)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Audit write failed: {e}")
    # Continues as if nothing happened

# RIGHT — audit failure stops the operation
write_audit_record(transaction)
# If this fails, the exception propagates.
# The calling code must handle it — not silently continue.
```

**Q2 to ask:** "If this operation fails, does someone need to *know* it failed — not just that something was logged?"

In the taxonomy, this is *Audit Trail Destruction* — rated *High*. The code appears to handle errors gracefully, but "graceful" is the wrong response when the audit trail is the legal record. A gap in the audit trail is not a logging failure — it is a compliance failure that may have legal consequences.

> **Why This Matters:** Under many compliance frameworks, a missing audit record is not a bug — it may be treated as evidence of tampering rather than a technical failure.

### 2.3 The Invisible Promotion

The AI reads data from an external API and passes it directly to an internal function. The types match, the code runs, no errors. But the data just crossed from "untrusted external source" to "internal authoritative data" with no validation boundary.

```python
# WRONG — external data treated as internal
external_data = api_client.get_records()
process_internal_records(external_data)

# RIGHT — validate before promoting
external_data = api_client.get_records()
validated = validate_and_quarantine(external_data)
process_internal_records(validated)
# The validation function checks structure, types, ranges,
# and flags anything that doesn't match expectations.
```

**Q3 to ask:** "Did this data come from *us* or from *outside*? Am I treating outside data as if we produced it?"

In the taxonomy, this is *Authority Tier Conflation* — rated *Critical*, the highest severity. The AI sees both data sources as "a dictionary" and treats them identically because nothing in the programming language distinguishes them. Once external data enters your internal data store without validation, every downstream consumer trusts it as if your system produced it.

> **Why This Matters:** This is how a partner API's data quality problems become your reporting errors — and nothing in your system will distinguish their data from yours. If the API sends bad data, your reports are wrong, your dashboards are wrong, and every decision made from them is based on unvalidated external input that your system treated as authoritative.

A closely related pattern: AI-generated code that accepts an external system's *assertion* and acts on it without question. A partner API says `"verified": true` and the code grants system access — without independent verification, without recording the basis for the decision, and without considering what happens if the partner system is compromised or simply changes its contract. External systems can stop sending fields, change their meaning, or start returning unexpected shapes — and AI-generated code typically handles all of these silently rather than surfacing them. If the API stops sending a `username` field tomorrow and the code `.get()`s a default instead of failing, you have users with no identity attached to their session. The question is the same: "Am I trusting an external system's shape, values, and claims as if we verified them ourselves?"


## 3. The Five Questions

These five questions work against any AI-generated code that touches data you care about. You do not need to understand every line of code to use them — they are designed to catch the patterns above by asking about *consequences*, not syntax.

- **Q1. If this value is missing, does my code crash or invent an answer?** Crashing is usually safer than inventing. A crash tells you something is broken. A silent default tells you everything is fine when it might not be.

- **Q2. If this operation fails, does my code tell someone or quietly continue?** Quiet continuation destroys audit trails. If an audit-critical operation fails and the code carries on, the audit trail has a gap that cannot be reconstructed.

- **Q3. Where did this data come from? Am I checking it or trusting it?** The boundary between "ours" and "outside" is where risk concentrates. Data from an external API, a user upload, or a partner system should be validated before it enters your internal processes.

- **Q4. Did AI suggest this pattern? Do I understand why it chose this over another?** AI defaults to what is common, not what is correct for your context. The patterns in Section 2 are all standard good practice in general software — they are dangerous specifically because AI does not distinguish your context from a web tutorial. *In practice:* the AI generated `ON CONFLICT (case_id) DO UPDATE` for the audit table. You could have used `INSERT` without `ON CONFLICT` — which would fail on a duplicate, forcing investigation. The question is: did you make that choice, or did the AI make it for you? If you do not know why it chose one over the other, ask it.

- **Q5. If this code is wrong, how would I find out?** If the answer is "I wouldn't," that is your highest-priority hot path. Silent failures are the hardest to detect and the most damaging in government systems. *In practice:* the reporting script produces a summary CSV. If it wrote "Unknown" for every department for three months, would your current process catch that? If the answer is "probably not until someone noticed the dashboard looked wrong," then the CSV output is a hot path — and you need an output check, not just a code check.

Print these. Pin them next to your monitor. Run through them every time you accept AI-generated code that touches classification, PII (personally identifiable information), financial data, or audit records.

> **Questions to Ask Your IT Security Team:** "We use AI to generate scripts that touch [classification/PII/financial] data. Do we have any static analysis rules that would catch the patterns described in this guide? If not, what is the interim guidance for our team?"
>
> Your IT security team may not have encountered this specific risk class yet — it is new, and the existing frameworks do not cover it. That is normal. You are not reporting a failure; you are putting a new risk on their radar. Bring this guide and the companion document (*Understanding AI Code Risk in Government Systems*). Suggest a 30-minute meeting to walk through the three patterns together.


## 4. How This Connects to What You Already Know

If you work in government IT, you are already familiar with several of the frameworks that this guide extends into new territory.

| If you know... | Then this maps to... |
|---|---|
| PSPF classification obligations | The friendly default (Section 2.1) — silent classification downgrade. Q1 catches the pattern where AI invents a classification instead of surfacing a missing one. |
| ISM controls for software development | Q1–Q5 extend ISM review into *semantic* territory — not "is the code structured correctly?" but "does the code do the right thing in this institutional context?" |
| Essential Eight patching and hardening | These patterns are not caught by Essential Eight — they sit in the gap between infrastructure-level security and application-level semantic correctness. E8 protects the platform; Q1–Q5 protect the logic running on it. |
| Audit and accountability requirements | The helpful error handler (Section 2.2) — audit trail destruction. Q2 catches the pattern where AI swallows the exception that should have preserved the audit record. |
| Data sovereignty and data handling | The invisible promotion (Section 2.3) — untrusted data entering authoritative paths. Q3 catches the pattern where AI treats external data as if it came from an internal, trusted source. |

The five questions are not a replacement for these frameworks. They are an extension into a gap that existing frameworks were not designed to cover: the semantic correctness of AI-generated code.


## 5. Finding Your Hot Paths

Not all code is equally dangerous. A function that formats dates is not the same as a function that decides what security classification to apply. Most of the risk in a 500-line script concentrates in perhaps 30 lines. Those 30 lines are your *hot paths* — the places where Q1–Q5 matter most.[^hot-paths]

[^hot-paths]: The full discussion paper calls these *high-stakes code paths* — code where a wrong answer has consequences for security, compliance, or people. "Hot path" is the same concept in plainer language.

### 5.1 What makes a path "hot"

A code path is hot if **a wrong answer has real-world consequences.** That means it touches classifications, PII, financial amounts, audit records, access decisions, or any data where corruption or silent mishandling affects people, compliance, or trust. Defaulting a missing location in a weather app is not a hot path — a wrong forecast inconveniences someone. Defaulting a missing security classification is a hot path — that decision downgrades documents and nobody is told.

Everything else — formatting, logging messages, building display strings, iterating over lists — is not where the risk lives. Focus your review energy on the hot paths.

**Once you've found a hot path, look for these behaviours inside it:**

- **Data handling and assignment.** How does the code deal with the data flowing through this path? What happens if a value is missing, malformed, or unexpected — does the code crash, invent a default, or silently coerce it into something else? (Q1, Q3)
- **Exception handling.** How does the code deal with failures in this path? Are errors reported to someone who can act, or are they logged and swallowed? Does the error handler preserve the audit trail or destroy it? (Q2)
- **Boundary crossings.** Does data enter this path from outside — an external API, a user upload, a partner system — and get used without validation? Does the code distinguish between "ours" and "not ours"? (Q3)
- **Implicit decisions.** Is the code making a policy decision without being explicit about it? A `.get()` with a default is a policy decision: "if this value is missing, use this one instead." A `try/except` that continues is a policy decision: "if this fails, carry on as if it did not." These decisions are fine in low-consequence code. In a hot path, they need to be deliberate and visible. (Q4, Q5)

### 5.2 A walkthrough: finding the hot lines in a reporting script

Here is a small reporting script that reads records from an external partner API, processes them, and writes summary rows to a local database. It is about 30 lines long. The comments mark which lines are hot and which question applies. Lines that are not hot paths — setup, formatting, cleanup — are marked "cold."

```python
import requests
import sqlite3
from datetime import datetime

def generate_partner_report(api_url, db_path):
    # --- HOT (Q3): db_path comes from the caller — and every
    #     hot line below depends on this connection working. ---
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    report_date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

    # --- HOT (Q3): data crosses from external to internal ---
    # --- HOT (Q4): AI chose .json() with no error handling — do you know why? ---
    response = requests.get(f"{api_url}/daily-summary")
    records = response.json()

    for record in records:
        # --- HOT (Q1): what if "department" is missing? ---
        dept = record.get("department", "Unknown")

        # --- HOT (Q1): what if "total_amount" is missing? ---
        amount = record.get("total_amount", 0)

        # --- HOT (Q3): external data inserted without validation ---
        cursor.execute(
            "INSERT INTO daily_reports (report_date, department, amount) "
            "VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
            (report_date, dept, amount),
        )

    # --- HOT (Q2): what if the commit fails? ---
    try:
        conn.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Database error: {e}")
        # Silently continues — report data may be partially written

    # --- Cold: timing stats — nice to have, not load-bearing ---
    try:
        elapsed = (datetime.now() - datetime.strptime(report_date, "%Y-%m-%d")).seconds
        print(f"Report took {elapsed}s for {len(records)} records")
    except Exception:
        pass  # Stats are cosmetic — swallowing this is fine

    conn.close()

    # --- HOT (Q5): this returns "success" regardless — how would you know
    #     if the data was wrong? ---
    return f"Report generated for {report_date}"
```

Now apply the five questions to the hot lines:

**Q1 — the `.get()` defaults:** If `department` is missing, the script writes "Unknown" to the database. If `total_amount` is missing, it writes 0. Are these values *normal defaults* or *evidence that the partner API sent bad data*? In a financial reporting context, a department of "Unknown" and an amount of 0 will pollute your reports silently. Fix: access the keys directly and let missing data raise an error.

**Q3 — the external data path:** The data from `response.json()` is external. It is inserted directly into the local database with no validation. The partner API could send unexpected fields, wrong types, or missing required data — and the script will write whatever it receives. Fix: validate the structure of each record before inserting.

**Q2 — the `try/except` block:** If `conn.commit()` fails, the script prints the error and continues. The return message says "Report generated" even if the data was never committed. Fix: let the exception propagate so the caller knows the report failed.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
def generate_partner_report(api_url, db_path):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    report_date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

    response = requests.get(f"{api_url}/daily-summary")
    response.raise_for_status()  # Q3: fail on HTTP errors
    records = response.json()

    for record in records:
        # Q3: validate external data before internal use
        if "department" not in record or "total_amount" not in record:
            raise ValueError(
                f"Partner record missing required fields: {record}"
            )
        # Q1: no silent defaults — use validated values directly
        dept = record["department"]
        amount = record["total_amount"]

        if not isinstance(amount, (int, float)):
            raise TypeError(
                f"Expected numeric total_amount, got {type(amount)}: {amount}"
            )

        cursor.execute(
            "INSERT INTO daily_reports (report_date, department, amount) "
            "VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
            (report_date, dept, amount),
        )

    # Q2: no try/except — if commit fails, the caller must know
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    return f"Report generated for {report_date}"
```

The corrected version is about the same length. It does not add complexity — it removes silent failures and makes problems visible.

### 5.3 SQL hot paths

If your scripts include SQL — queries, inserts, data transformations — the same three patterns apply. AI generates SQL with the same blind spots it has in Python.

**The SQL-flavoured friendly default (Q1):**

```sql
-- WRONG — silently invents a classification when the field is NULL
SELECT
    document_id,
    COALESCE(security_classification, 'OFFICIAL') AS classification
FROM documents;
-- If security_classification is NULL, it means the classification
-- is unknown — not that it should be OFFICIAL.

-- RIGHT — surface the problem
SELECT
    document_id,
    security_classification AS classification
FROM documents
WHERE security_classification IS NOT NULL;
-- Handle NULLs separately — investigate why they are missing.
```

`COALESCE` is the SQL version of `.get()` with a default. In a reporting query, it silently converts "we do not know the classification" into "OFFICIAL" — and anyone reading the report sees a confident answer.

**The SQL-flavoured invisible promotion (Q3):**

```sql
-- WRONG — external data inserted directly into internal table
INSERT INTO internal_records (name, department, clearance_level)
SELECT name, department, clearance_level
FROM external_staging;
-- No validation. external_staging could contain anything.

-- RIGHT — validate at the boundary
INSERT INTO internal_records (name, department, clearance_level)
SELECT name, department, clearance_level
FROM external_staging
WHERE clearance_level IN ('BASELINE', 'NV1', 'NV2', 'PV')
  AND department IS NOT NULL
  AND name IS NOT NULL;
-- Reject rows that don't match expected values.
-- Investigate rejected rows separately.
```

`INSERT INTO ... SELECT FROM` without a `WHERE` clause is the SQL equivalent of passing external data directly to an internal function. The database does not care where the data came from — it trusts whatever you give it.

**The SQL-flavoured error swallowing (Q2):**

```sql
-- WRONG — silently overwrites existing records
INSERT INTO audit_decisions (case_id, decision, decided_by, decided_at)
VALUES (1042, 'APPROVED', 'jsmith', '2026-03-18')
ON CONFLICT (case_id)
DO UPDATE SET
    decision = EXCLUDED.decision,
    decided_by = EXCLUDED.decided_by,
    decided_at = EXCLUDED.decided_at;
-- If case 1042 already has a decision, this silently replaces it.
-- The original decision is gone. No record that it was changed.

-- RIGHT — conflict means something went wrong
INSERT INTO audit_decisions (case_id, decision, decided_by, decided_at)
VALUES (1042, 'APPROVED', 'jsmith', '2026-03-18');
-- If case 1042 already has a decision, this fails with a constraint
-- violation — which is what you want. A duplicate decision is a
-- problem to investigate, not a conflict to silently resolve.
```

`ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` is the SQL version of a `try/except` that silently continues. In an audit context, a conflict on a decision record means something has gone wrong — a case was decided twice, or a record was duplicated. Silently overwriting it destroys the evidence.

### 5.4 When this guide stops being enough

This guide works for scripts up to a few thousand lines where you are the primary author and reviewer. If your project has grown beyond that — multiple contributors, dependencies on other systems, or code that other teams rely on — you need developer support.

The threshold is not exact, but these are signals:

- Your project has grown to multiple interconnected scripts that depend on each other.
- You have users who are not on your team.
- You cannot hold the whole codebase in your head.
- You are spending more time reviewing AI output than writing prompts.

At that point, engage your IT team or a developer to help apply the five questions at scale. The patterns are the same — they just need to be enforced systematically rather than manually.


## 6. Using AI to Review AI-Generated Code

> **Important caveat:** Unprompted AI review will miss the same patterns it introduced — it has the same training-data blind spots whether writing or reviewing. Prompted review is substantially better: when you tell AI exactly what to look for, it can find patterns it would not have avoided during generation. Use these prompts as a supplement to your own review against Q1–Q5, not as a replacement — but prompted and monitored AI review is dramatically better than no review at all.

You already use AI to write code. You can also use it to review code — with the right prompts. Prompted review is substantially better than no review. The key insight is that AI is better at *finding* patterns when you tell it exactly what to look for than it is at *avoiding* those patterns when writing.

**Here is how to use AI to check AI-generated code:**

1. AI generates the code.
2. You read through it once, marking the hot paths (Section 5).
3. You paste the hot-path code back to the AI with the relevant prompt below.
4. You review the AI's findings against Q1–Q5 yourself.
5. You apply fixes where needed.

This takes 5–10 minutes per script. It is not perfect — but it is dramatically better than accepting AI output without review. The prompts below are designed for step 3.

### Prompts that work

Copy and paste these into your AI tool when reviewing AI-generated code:

**For Q1 — finding friendly defaults:**

> Review this code. For every `.get()`, `COALESCE`, default value, or fallback: tell me what happens if that value is genuinely missing. Is the default safe, or could it mask a real problem? For each one, tell me whether the missing value is "normal and expected" or "evidence that something upstream is broken."

**For Q2 — finding error swallowing:**

> Review this code. For every try/except, catch block, or error handler: tell me what happens to the error. Is it reported to someone who can act on it, or is it logged and ignored? For each one, tell me: if this operation fails in production, will a human find out before the next audit?

**For Q3 — finding boundary crossings:**

> Review this code. Identify every place where data from an external source (API, file, user input, partner system) is used in an internal function or written to an internal database. Is there a validation step between the source and the use? For each one, tell me what would happen if the external source sent unexpected or malformed data.

**For the full checklist:**

> Review this code against these five questions: (1) Do missing values crash or get a silent default? (2) Do failed operations get reported or quietly swallowed? (3) Is external data validated before internal use? (4) Are there patterns here that could have been different — and can you explain why this approach was chosen over alternatives? (5) If this code produces a wrong answer, what would make that visible? For each finding, rate it as HIGH (touches classification, PII, financial, or audit data), MEDIUM (touches operational data), or LOW (cosmetic or non-consequential).

**For SQL (Q1, Q2, Q3):**

> Review this SQL. For every COALESCE, ISNULL, or default value: what happens if that column is genuinely NULL — is the default safe or could it mask a data quality problem? For every INSERT INTO ... SELECT FROM: is the source data validated before insertion? For every ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE: could a silent overwrite destroy audit-relevant information?

### What these prompts will — and will not — catch

These prompts are one layer in a defence-in-depth approach to reviewing AI-generated code. They will surface issues you would miss on a casual read-through, and the specialist perspectives (Section 10) catch different classes of problem than the pattern-specific prompts above. But they have real limitations:

- **AI review has the same blind spots as AI generation.** The same training-data biases that cause AI to produce these patterns also limit its ability to find them. A prompted review is better than no review, but it is not equivalent to a human expert review or automated static analysis.
- **These prompts catch *known pattern classes*, not novel defects.** They work because they tell AI exactly what to look for. They will not catch a new class of problem that nobody has described yet.
- **This guide is not a substitute for security testing, code review, or automated analysis.** If your project has access to static analysis tools, a CI pipeline, or security review from qualified professionals, those controls are stronger than anything in this section. This guide exists for the gap where those controls are not available — scripts written by individuals without access to professional tooling.

Use these prompts alongside whatever other review practices you have, not instead of them. If your only review process is this guide, that is better than no review — but recognise it as a starting point, not an endpoint. The goal is to build towards automated enforcement (Section 8) where the three pattern checks (Q1–Q3) are checked by machines on every commit, as part of a layered assurance approach where no single control is expected to catch everything.


## 7. What To Do When You Find a Problem

The five questions flagged something. Now what?

First: do not panic. These are silent defects — they produce wrong answers, not crashes. They are not actively being exploited. You have time to fix them properly.

### If it is in code you have not deployed yet

Fix it before deploying. Use the corrected patterns from Section 2 as templates. If you are not sure how to fix it, ask the AI — but verify the fix against the relevant question (Q1–Q5) before accepting it. AI is quite good at fixing a specific pattern when you tell it exactly what is wrong; it is bad at spotting the pattern in the first place.

### If it is in code that is already running

These defects are producing wrong answers, not crashing. They have likely been producing wrong answers since the code was deployed. That sounds alarming, but it means the situation is stable — it is not getting worse while you take time to fix it properly.

1. **Assess the impact.** What data does this code touch? What is the worst case if the pattern has been producing wrong results? A friendly default on a department name is less urgent than a friendly default on a security classification. For example: if the friendly default has been writing "Unknown" as the department for six months of daily reports, how many downstream reports, dashboards, or decisions relied on that department field? That is your blast radius.

2. **Fix the code.** Apply the corrected pattern from Section 2. Test the fix. Deploy it.

3. **Check the output.** If possible, review recent outputs for evidence of the defect. Look for records with default values where you would expect real data — "Unknown" departments, zero-value amounts, OFFICIAL classifications on records that should be higher. If your data is in a database, a simple query can surface these:

    ```sql
    -- Find records that may have been affected by a friendly default
    SELECT * FROM daily_reports
    WHERE department = 'Unknown' OR amount = 0;
    ```

4. **Tell someone.** If the code touches classified, PII, or auditable data and you believe incorrect results may have been produced, notify your team lead or IT security contact. Frame it as a quality finding, not a security incident: "I found a pattern in our reporting script that may have been producing incorrect default values for [field]. I have fixed the code and I am reviewing recent outputs. I wanted to let you know in case this affects [downstream process]."

### If you are not sure whether it is a problem

Ask. Use the IT security conversation framing from Section 3. A false alarm costs a 30-minute meeting. A missed defect on classified data costs substantially more.

### One thing you can do today that costs nothing

Put your scripts in version control (git). Even if you are the only person working on them. Version control means you can see what changed, when, and — critically — you can undo a change that turns out to be wrong. If you discover a friendly default that has been producing incorrect results, version control tells you when it was introduced and what the output looked like before. Without it, you are guessing.

This is not a security control — it is basic hygiene, and it makes every other practice in this guide more effective.


## 8. When You Need More Than This Guide

This guide is interim — it works when you are the only reviewer and there is no automated tooling. It is a manual process by design, because most government staff using AI to write code do not have access to CI pipelines, static analysis tools, or pre-commit hooks.

Automated detection is being designed. Semantic enforcement tooling would encode the three pattern checks (Q1–Q3) as machine-enforceable rules that run automatically every time code is saved or submitted. A companion specification illustrates one way to build this; other approaches using existing static analysis tools (such as semgrep or CodeQL custom rules) could target the same patterns. The key insight is that Q1–Q3 are automatable regardless of which tooling implements them — the patterns are specific enough for machines to check. When that tooling arrives, those checks will run automatically so you do not have to hold them all in your head. The two judgement calls (Q4–Q5) remain with human reviewers.

The empirical evidence is encouraging: in a case study on an approximately 80,000-line Python codebase, a combination of rigorous review and internal tooling regularly catches and blocks these patterns before they enter the codebase[^rate-caveats] — typically one to two per day. This rate occurs *despite* the AI being explicitly instructed not to produce those patterns, and violations were also found incidentally during a week of non-development work, suggesting the daily rate is a floor. Without that detection capability, every one of those violations would have passed normal code review — because they look like correct, well-written code.

That is what the five questions are catching manually. The gap between "what this guide catches" and "what automated tooling would catch" is real, but the five questions cover the three highest-impact patterns and give you a defensible review process in the interim.

As your project grows:

- **Immediate:** Ask your IT security team about static analysis rules for the three patterns in Section 2.
- **Near-term:** Semantic enforcement tooling — as illustrated by the companion specification — could provide machine-checkable rules for the three pattern checks (Q1–Q3), integrated into the development workflow using existing static analysis tools.
- **The key insight:** Everything in this guide maps to an automatable pattern check. You have been learning the intuition; the tools encode it so you do not have to hold it all in your head.

**If your concern is governance rather than code** — the systemic risk, the framework gaps, the procurement implications — see *Understanding AI Code Risk in Government Systems* for the policy response. That document covers the "why" behind the "what" in this guide: why these defects are a systemic problem, what existing frameworks miss, and what government needs to do about it.

**Three patterns AI gets wrong in government code:**

- **The Friendly Default** — AI invents a value (e.g., OFFICIAL) when data is missing, instead of raising an error
- **The Helpful Error Handler** — AI catches and swallows audit-critical errors instead of letting them propagate
- **The Invisible Promotion** — AI treats external/untrusted data as internal/trusted without validation

**Five review questions for AI-generated code (Q1–Q5):**

- Q1. Missing value — does the code crash or silently invent an answer?
- Q2. Failed operation — does someone find out, or is it logged and ignored?
- Q3. External data — is it validated before use, or trusted on arrival?
- Q4. AI-suggested pattern — do I understand why it chose this approach?
- Q5. Wrong answer — if this code is wrong, how would I find out?

**The empirical case:**

- A combination of rigorous review and internal tooling on one ~80,000-line codebase regularly catches and blocks these patterns[^rate-caveats] — typically one to two per day, none entering the codebase (blocked by a combination of automated enforcement gates and human review)
- This occurs despite the AI being explicitly instructed not to produce them
- Without equivalent detection, these patterns would pass normal code review

**Questions for your IT security team:**

- Do we have static analysis rules that catch silent defaults, error swallowing, or unvalidated external data promotion?
- What is our interim guidance for reviewing AI-generated code?
- Should we be tracking which scripts and systems include AI-generated code?

**Questions for your CTO or executive:**

- Are our contracted suppliers using AI coding tools? Do we have visibility into how that code is reviewed?
- Does our security testing detect semantic defects — code that is correct but does the wrong thing?
- What would first-stage detection controls cost vs. the risk of undetected silent defects?

**If you found a problem in running code:**

- Assess what data it touches and the worst-case impact
- Fix the pattern using the corrected examples in this guide
- Check recent outputs for evidence of incorrect defaults or missing records
- If it touches classified, PII, or auditable data, notify your team lead
- Frame it as a quality finding, not a security incident

**Three things you can do today:**

- Focus your review on **hot paths** — the 30 lines where Q1–Q5 matter most (Section 5)
- Use the **AI review prompts** in Section 6 to check AI-generated code before accepting it
- Put your scripts in **version control** (git) — even if you are the only person working on them

**Where to go deeper** (all documents available from the Digital Transformation Agency):

- *Understanding AI Code Risk in Government Systems*: systemic risk for policy advisors
- *When Good Code Becomes Dangerous* (discussion paper): full technical threat model and taxonomy
- Companion specification (Wardline): one illustration of semantic enforcement tooling, for tool builders and assessors

## 10. Specialist Perspective Prompts (Reference)

*These prompts ask AI to review your code from a particular professional perspective. They are reference material — use them when you want deeper analysis beyond the pattern-specific prompts in Section 6. Each perspective catches different things because each role cares about different consequences.*

**Systems thinker:** "Review this code as a systems thinker. What feedback loops exist? If this code runs daily, are there any cases where today's output becomes tomorrow's input and a small error could compound over time? Are there places where a silent default today would be treated as real data tomorrow?"

**Systems engineer:** "Review this code as a systems engineer. For each operation that could fail: what is the failure mode? Does the code degrade gracefully or does it mask the failure? Is there any operation where a partial failure could leave the system in an inconsistent state?"

**Quality engineer:** "Review this code as a quality engineer. For each output this code produces: how would I verify that the output is correct, not just that the code ran without errors? Are there any operations where the code could produce a plausible but incorrect result that would pass every automated check?"

**Data engineer:** "Review this code as a data engineer. Trace the data from its source to its final destination. Are there places where a NULL or missing value would propagate silently through transformations and appear as a valid-looking value in the output? If the source schema changed, would this code fail visibly or produce silently wrong results?"

**Auditor:** "Review this code as an auditor. For each decision the code makes: is there a record of what decision was made, what input led to that decision, and when it happened? Are there any paths where an operation completes successfully but leaves no trace that it happened?"

**Privacy officer:** "Review this code as a data protection officer. What personal information, credentials, or sensitive data passes through this code? For each piece: is it written to any log, error message, temporary file, or output that persists beyond the immediate operation?"

**Security analyst:** "Review this code as a security analyst. What inputs does this code accept, and are any of them user-controllable or externally influenced? Could any input be crafted to change the code's behaviour? If an attacker controlled the external data source, what is the worst they could achieve?"

**Data analyst:** "Review this code as a data analyst. Are there cases where NULL values would be silently excluded from a count or average? Could any filter condition accidentally exclude valid records? Are there any places where the code assumes data completeness that the source cannot guarantee?"

## Glossary

**Audit trail:** A chronological record of who did what, when, and why. In government systems, gaps in the audit trail can have legal consequences — a missing record may be treated as evidence of tampering rather than as a technical failure.

**Authority tier:** A way of classifying data by how much you should trust it. This guide uses three practical levels: *internal* (produced by your system — highest trust), *validated* (came from outside but passed through checks), and *external* (not yet checked — lowest trust). The discussion paper (§5) introduces the four-tier model; the Wardline specification (§4) formally defines it, adding a distinction between shape-validated and semantically validated data. The patterns in this guide are dangerous because AI does not distinguish between tiers — it treats all data the same.

**CI pipeline (Continuous Integration):** An automated system that runs checks on code every time it is changed. If you do not have one, the five questions in this guide are your manual equivalent.

**COALESCE:** A SQL function that returns the first non-NULL value from a list. `COALESCE(security_classification, 'OFFICIAL')` is the SQL equivalent of Python's `.get()` with a default — it silently substitutes a value when the real one is missing.

**Competence Spoofing:** The taxonomy name for the Friendly Default pattern (Section 2.1). The code presents a confident result based on fabricated input — it "spoofs" competence by inventing answers instead of admitting it does not know. (Discussion paper reference: ACF-S1.)

**Audit Trail Destruction:** The taxonomy name for the Helpful Error Handler pattern (Section 2.2). A broad exception handler catches an audit-critical failure and logs it instead of propagating it, creating a gap in the legal record. (Discussion paper reference: ACF-R1.)

**Authority Tier Conflation:** The taxonomy name for the Invisible Promotion pattern (Section 2.3). Data from an untrusted external source is used in a trusted internal context without validation, silently elevating its authority. (Discussion paper reference: ACF-T1.)

**Default value:** A value that code uses when the real value is missing. In general software, defaults are helpful. In government systems handling sensitive data, a default can silently fabricate an answer that should have been an error.

**Defence-in-depth:** A security principle where multiple independent layers of protection are used so that no single layer's failure compromises the whole system. In the context of this guide: the combination of your own review (Q1–Q5), AI-assisted prompted review (Section 6), and eventually automated enforcement (Section 8) form three layers — each catches different things.

**Exception handler:** Code that catches errors and decides what to do with them. The danger in government systems is handlers that catch errors and quietly continue, rather than surfacing the failure to someone who can act on it.

**Hot path:** A section of code where the five questions matter most — where the code touches sensitive data, makes decisions about missing values, crosses trust boundaries, or handles errors from compliance-critical operations.

**IRAP (Information Security Registered Assessors Program):** A programme administered by ASD/ACSC that accredits security assessors to evaluate government systems against the ISM. When this guide or the discussion paper refers to "IRAP assessment," it means an independent security evaluation conducted by an accredited assessor — the primary mechanism by which government agencies demonstrate that their systems meet security requirements.

**ISM (Information Security Manual):** The Australian Government's cybersecurity framework, maintained by the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) and its Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC). The patterns in this guide sit in a gap that the ISM was not designed to cover — semantic correctness of application logic.

**PII (Personally Identifiable Information):** Data that can identify a specific person — names, tax file numbers, dates of birth, contact details. Government systems handling PII have legal obligations about how it is stored, logged, and transmitted.

**Pre-commit hook:** An automated check that runs on your code before it is saved to version control. If the check fails, the save is blocked. This guide's five questions are the manual equivalent of what a pre-commit hook does automatically.

**PSPF (Protective Security Policy Framework):** The Australian Government's framework for protective security, including information classification. The Friendly Default pattern (Section 2.1) can silently violate PSPF classification requirements by defaulting to OFFICIAL when the real classification is unknown.

**Semantic correctness:** Whether code does the right thing in its institutional context — not just running without errors, but producing correct results for the specific system it operates in. The five questions in this guide are all tests for semantic correctness. See the discussion paper (§1.3) for the formal definition.

**Semantic defect:** A bug where the code runs correctly but does the wrong thing. It does not crash, does not throw errors, and passes all tests — but produces an incorrect result. The patterns in this guide are all semantic defects.

**Silent failure:** When code fails without telling anyone. The opposite of crashing. In most software, silent failures are considered poor practice. In government systems, they can mean incorrect classifications, broken audit trails, or unvalidated data entering decision-making processes.

**Static analysis:** Automated examination of code without running it — a tool reads the source text and flags patterns that match known problems. Linters, type checkers, and security scanners are all forms of static analysis.

**Trust boundary:** The line between data you control and data from outside. Every time data crosses this boundary, it should be validated. AI routinely generates code that ignores trust boundaries because the programming language does not distinguish between internal and external data.

**Semantic enforcement tooling:** A new category of automated check that encodes institutional rules — "this field must never receive a default," "this error must reach the audit trail" — into machine-enforceable declarations. The three pattern checks from this guide (Q1–Q3) — fabricated defaults, swallowed exceptions, and unvalidated trust boundary crossings — are the kind of rules semantic enforcement tooling targets; the two judgement calls (Q4–Q5) remain with human reviewers. The companion Wardline specification illustrates one way to build this — formal pattern rules, structural verification rules, and a governance model — but several implementation paths are viable, including custom rules for existing static analysis tools (such as semgrep or CodeQL).

[^rate-caveats]: Two caveats on this figure. (1) This rate occurs predominantly during unplanned work — bug fixing, ad-hoc refactoring, small feature additions — where the agent improvises from training data rather than following a reviewed specification. (2) The structural argument — that these patterns are embedded in training data and that agents lack persistent learning — remains valid regardless of the specific rate. The "one to two" framing reflects incomplete tool coverage and incidental discovery during non-development work. See the discussion paper §8.4 for the full case study.
